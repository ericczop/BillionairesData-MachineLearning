# Billionaires Data
This project aims to explore whether basic economic indicators, such as a country's wealth per person (**GDP per capita**), the rate of price changes (**Consumer Price Index or CPI**), and the **total tax rate**, can be utilized to estimate the number of billionaires in that country. The goal is to investigate the connection between these economic factors and the presence of billionaires. By collecting relevant information and analyzing patterns in the data, we aim to determine if there's a simple way to predict the number of billionaires based on these economic signals. If successful, this research could provide valuable insights for understanding the relationship between common economic indicators and the occurrence of billionaires in a given country.
